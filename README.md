## üëã Overview
InterCode is a **lightweight, flexible, and easy-to-use framework** for designing interactive code environments. Following the popular [`gym`](https://gymnasium.farama.org/) interface definition, InterCode makes it easy to quickly define a code environment and deploy an agent to operate in code within the context of the environment.

For an overview of InterCode, building interactive code tasks with InterCode, and evaluating agents on InterCode environments, please check out our [wiki](https://github.com/princeton-nlp/intercode/wiki), [website](https://intercode-benchmark.github.io/), and the original paper:

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation
You can install InterCode as a pypi package or by building from source.

> **Note**
> InterCode requires the following installations to run:
> * `python` >= 3.8
> * `anaconda`/`miniconda`: Learn more [here](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) to install.
> * `docker`: Learn more [here](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) to install.

1. Install via pip ([pypi package](https://pypi.org/project/intercode-bench/)):
```bash
pip install intercode-bench
```

2. Build from source:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/princeton-nlp/intercode.git
cd intercode
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate intercode
```

## üöÄ Quick Start
To confirm that the above installation worked.
* Clone this repository
* Run `./setup.sh`
* Run `python run_sql.py` 

If InterCode was installed successfully, the InterCode SQL environment should be started successfully and a CLI interpreter should appear, allowing you to enter `SQL` commands
to interact with the task setting.
