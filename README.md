## üëã Overview
InterCode is a **lightweight, flexible, and easy-to-use framework** for designing interactive code environments. Following the popular [`gym`](https://gymnasium.farama.org/) interface definition, InterCode makes it easy to quickly define a code environment and deploy an agent to operate in code within the context of the environment.

For an overview of InterCode, building interactive code tasks with InterCode, and evaluating agents on InterCode environments, please check out our [wiki](https://github.com/princeton-nlp/intercode/wiki), [website](https://intercode-benchmark.github.io/), and the original paper:

## üöÄ Quick Start
You can install InterCode as a PyPI package or by building from source.

> **Note**
> InterCode requires the following installations to run:
> * `python` >= 3.8
> * `docker`: Learn more [here](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) to install.

### üêç PyPI Package
1. Install the ([pypi package](https://pypi.org/project/intercode-bench/)):
```bash
pip install intercode-bench
```
2. Copy + Paste the following code for interacting with the InterCode Bash environment into a python file (i.e. `run_bash.py`)
```python
from intercode.assets import bash_build_docker, bash_image_name, bash_test_data
from intercode.envs import BashEnv

if __name__ == '__main__':
    bash_build_docker()
    env = BashEnv(bash_image_name, data_path=bash_test_data, traj_dir="logs/", verbose=True)

    try:
        for idx in range(3):
            env.reset()
            obs, done = env.observation, False
            while not done:
                action = input('> ')
                obs, reward, done, info = env.step(action)
    except KeyboardInterrupt:
        print("Keyboard interrupt detected")
    finally:
        env.close()
```
3. Run the file (i.e. `python run_bash.py`)

If InterCode was installed successfully, the InterCode Bash environment should be started successfully and a CLI interpreter should appear, allowing you to enter `bash` commands
to interact with the task setting. Similar starter code for the InterCode SQL environment is available on the PyPI [page](https://pypi.org/project/intercode-bench/).

### üíΩ Build from Source
1. Clone this repository, create a virtual environment, and install necessary dependencies
```bash
git clone https://github.com/princeton-nlp/intercode.git
cd intercode
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate intercode
```
2. Run `setup.sh` to create the docker images for the InterCode Bash, SQL, and CTF environments
3. Run `python run_sql.py` 

If InterCode was installed successfully, the InterCode SQL environment should be started successfully and a CLI interpreter should appear, allowing you to enter `SQL` commands
to interact with the task environment. You can also run `run_bash.py` and `run_ctf.py` to explore the Bash and CTF task environments.
